# hello-world
I'm here to learn Github!
I'm an austin-based writer looking to improve his technical writing skills through volunteering.
I want to write a new line and add a comment.
### Italics
If I want to write text in italics, I will put astericks around the word like *this*.
### Bold
If I want to write text in bold, I will put two astericks around the words like **this**. I could even combine them by using both astericks and underscores like this: _I can **combine** them_.
### Lists
If I want to write a list, I can use astericks, numbers, or dashes:
* Milk
* Sugar
* Eggs
  * Brown, large
1. Bread
2. Apples
3. Bananas
- Peanut butter
  - Crunchy
- Jelly
  - Grape
### Blockquotes
Arthur C. Clark's third law:
> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
### Images and Links

### Code
If I want to write code in the same line as text, I simply have to use backticks: `this is code = yes it is`. I can also block out a longer bit of code using an indent of four spaces:
    
    this is code {yep it sure is}
    
The following if an example of code fencing which uses three backticks in the place of indents:
```
this is code fencing = true
```
Here is example of syntax highlighting using javascript:
```javascript
if (isCode){
  return true
}
```
